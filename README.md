# Mini Quora Clone REST API

Mini Quora Clone REST API is a backend project that replicates the core functionality of Quora that allows users to create, edit, and delete posts â€” similar to a basic version of the posting system on platforms like Quora. This API is designed to demonstrate fundamental REST principles, including:

Creating a new post

Editing an existing post

Deleting a post

Fetching all posts or a specific post

This project is designed to learn how to build and structure a RESTful API with basic CRUD operations.
